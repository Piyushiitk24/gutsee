# üß† Intelligent Assistant Design System - Stoma Tracker

## Overview
Transform the Stoma Tracker from a passive data collection tool into an **intelligent health companion** that anticipates needs, provides contextual insights, and guides users toward better outcomes.

## Core Design Philosophy: "The Intelligent Assistant"

> **"Bring the right input field to the user at the right time."**

The app shouldn't feel like a database you have to fill out. It should feel like an intelligent assistant that:
- Learns your patterns and preferences
- Anticipates your needs based on time and context
- Provides proactive insights and recommendations
- Makes logging effortless with smart suggestions
- Turns data into actionable wisdom
