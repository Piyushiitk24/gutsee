# Stoma Tracker - Comprehensive Colostomy Management AppA data-driven colostomy management application that helps users track food intake, monitor stoma output, and identify patterns through advanced analytics.## 🎯 Project OverviewThis application addresses the challenge of managing a colostomy by providing systematic tracking and pattern recognition capabilities. The goal is to achieve predictable 24-hour output-free periods through data-driven insights.## 🚀 Features### Core Functionality- **Food Logging**: Detailed ingredient breakdown with AI-powered analysis- **Stoma Output Tracking**: Volume, consistency, timing, and correlations- **Gas Production Monitoring**: Intensity, frequency, and trigger identification- **Irrigation Quality Tracking**: Effectiveness and timing optimization### Advanced Analytics- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify food triggers and safe combinations- **Predictive Scoring**: Risk assessment for planned meals- **Correlation Analysis**: Food-to-symptom relationship mapping- **Progress Tracking**: Visual dashboards and trend analysis### User Experience- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive interface optimized for smartphones- **Quick Entry**: <30 second logging with voice input and barcode scanning- **Offline Capabilities**: PWA functionality for uninterrupted use- **Visual Insights**: Interactive charts and progress indicators## 🛠️ Technical Stack- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with PostgreSQL- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM- **State Management**: React Context/Zustand- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons with custom components
- **PWA**: Next-PWA for offline functionality

## 📊 Data Models

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Profile and health information
- **Foods**: Nutritional data and ingredient breakdown
- **Meals**: Timestamped food consumption with portions
- **Outputs**: Stoma output tracking with context
- **Gas Sessions**: Frequency and intensity monitoring
- **Irrigations**: Quality and effectiveness tracking
- **Symptoms**: Correlation with food triggers
- **Patterns**: AI-generated insights and predictions

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives
- Achieve 24-hour output-free periods 70%+ of the time
- Reduce gas production by 30% during target hours
- Identify 10-15 safe meal combinations
- Establish consistent, predictable daily routine

### Key Performance Indicators
- **24-hour success rate**: Percentage of successful output-free periods
- **Gas reduction**: Decrease in problematic gas episodes
- **Pattern accuracy**: Prediction vs. actual outcome correlation
- **User engagement**: Daily logging compliance rate
